# Enable port reusage so we will be able to run multiple clients and servers on single (host, port). 
# Do not use socket.SO_REUSEADDR except you using linux(kernel<3.9): goto https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14388706/how-do-so-reuseaddr-and-so-reuseport-differ for more information.
# For linux hosts all sockets that want to share the same address and port combination must belong to processes that share the same effective user ID!
# So, on linux(kernel>=3.9) you have to run multiple servers and clients under one user to share the same (host, port).
